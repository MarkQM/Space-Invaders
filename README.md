# Space-Invaders

My recreation of the retro classic Space Invaders.
Hide behind cover for protection but, beware, they will block your shots too and won't last forever!
Place your shots well, your shots are limited. You can only shoot once your last shot has hit or gone off-screen.

## Controls

Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move your ship to the left and right to position yourself to shoot the alien ships!

Use the SPACE BAR to shoot.  

Have fun!
